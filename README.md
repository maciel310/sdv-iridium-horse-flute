# sdv-iridium-horse-flute
An upgraded Horse Flute mod for Stardew Valley

## About
This adds an Iridium Horse Flute to the game, which is a Tool instead of a generic "object".
This change makes it easier to find in your inventory (it's always sorted with the rest of your 
tools) and a little more intuitive to use. Another benefit is you automatically mount your horse
after summoning it, saving a little bit of effort.

## How to install
Download [Iridium Horse Flute from NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/15285)
and install like any other Stardew mod.
